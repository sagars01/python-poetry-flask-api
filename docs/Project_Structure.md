# Project Structure and Philosophy

## Overview

The `gigyeah-ai-engine` project is structured to facilitate easy development, scalability, and deployment of a Flask web application. This document outlines the project structure and the underlying philosophy guiding it, aiming to help new contributors understand how to navigate and build upon the project efficiently.

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure, organized primarily within the `src` directory. Here's an overview of the main components:

- **`src/`**: Contains all the source code for the application.
  - **`gigyeah_ai_engine/`**: The core application package.
    - **`__init__.py`**: Initializes the Flask app and brings together other components like Blueprints.
    - **`config.py`**: Contains configurations for different environments (development, testing, production).
    - **`models/`**: Houses the database models if the application uses a database.
    - **`views/`**: Contains the routes and views. It can be further organized into Blueprints for larger applications.
    - **`main/`**: A Blueprint for the main part of the application, including routes.
    - **`static/`**: Static files like CSS, JavaScript, and images.
    - **`templates/`**: Jinja2 templates for the application.
- **`tests/`**: Contains unit and integration tests.
- **`.env`**: Environment variables for local development (not tracked by Git).
- **`pyproject.toml`**: Defines the project dependencies and other Poetry configurations.
- **`.gitignore`**: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore.

## Philosophy

### Modularity

The project is designed to be modular, allowing developers to work on separate features or components without affecting the rest of the application. This is achieved through the use of Flask Blueprints, enabling scalable development and organization.

### Configuration Management

Configuration is centralized in `config.py`, facilitating easy adjustments and the management of different environments. The use of environment variables further enhances security and flexibility.

### Scalability

By organizing code into distinct modules and using Blueprints, the project is structured to scale. Whether scaling up with more features or scaling out to handle more traffic, the foundation is set to accommodate growth.

### Ease of Development

The project's structure aims to make the development process as straightforward as possible. With clear separation of concerns and comprehensive documentation, new contributors can easily understand the codebase and start contributing.

## Building Upon the Project

To build upon this project:

1. **Understand the Structure**: Familiarize yourself with the project's layout and where different types of files are located.
2. **Modularity is Key**: Leverage the modularity provided by Flask Blueprints to add new features or components.
3. **Environment Configuration**: Make use of the `config.py` and `.env` files for environment-specific configurations.
4. **Extend**: Add new models to `models/`, define new routes in `views/`, and enhance the user interface with additional templates and static files.

By adhering to the outlined structure and philosophy, developers can efficiently contribute to and evolve the `gigyeah-ai-engine` project.
